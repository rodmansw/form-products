Build a simple API that serves the product data in `products.json`. Simple CRUD endpoints are fine, though feel free to get creative.

* Deploy the API as a web server in a Docker container
* Please use TypeScript / JavaScript or Python for the server if you can, GraphQL endpoints a plus.
* Bonus points for using a separate database container, and networking the API server and database using Docker Compose.


## Prerequisite

- You will need to create a .env file based on .env.default
- PostgreSql (Optional PgAdmin 3/4)

### `yarn start`
